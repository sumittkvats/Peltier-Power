# Peltier Module and Axial Flux Generator

Welcome to the Peltier Module and Axial Flux Generator repository!

## Overview

This repository aims to explore and showcase the functionalities, applications, and working principles of Peltier modules and Axial Flux Generators. Both technologies have unique characteristics and versatile applications in various fields.

### Peltier Module

A Peltier module, also known as a thermoelectric cooler, operates on the Peltier effect to create a heat flux between two different conductive materials. This technology can generate a temperature difference across the module when an electric current passes through it. This repository includes:

- **Introduction:** Basics of the Peltier effect and how Peltier modules function.
- **Applications:** Explore real-world applications in cooling systems, temperature control, and more.
- **Demonstrations:** Sample code and projects demonstrating the use of Peltier modules.

### Axial Flux Generator

An Axial Flux Generator is a type of electric generator where the magnetic flux lines run parallel to the axis of rotation. It typically consists of stationary coils and rotating magnets or vice versa. In this repository, you'll find:

- **Overview:** Understanding the principles behind axial flux generators.
- **Designs:** Different designs and configurations of axial flux generators.
- **Practical Use:** Applications and practical implementations of axial flux generators.
